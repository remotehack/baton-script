# Baton Script

A format for sharing manuscripts to be read by several people.

## Format

There's a frontmatter section, which describes the characters and any meta information about the script.

Followed by markdown, where the headers relate to which character is talking

```md
---
characters:
  - Jane: an archaeologist, used to adventure
  - Phil: a pilot who delivers packages to remote places
---

## Jane

It'll be fine!

## Phil

I've got a bad feeling about this
