## Scene 1

Ryan and Ben are sat on a ski lift.

### Ryan

Hey Ben, I like your t-hyphen-shirt

### Ben

Thanks have you seen my ski jacket? It's radical

> the ski lift shakes

### Ryan

What was that?

### Ben

I really hope it's not that volcano that I heard was around here. I don't know why they would build a ski resort on an active volcano.

### Ryan

I really wish Pete were here. Pete would be way better at this than Ben because Ben can't even work dictation on his Mac

### Ben

Hello why is this not working oh my God this is amazing

> In a flash of lightning and rumbing of thunder Pete appears next to Ben

> Ben drops his goggles

### Pete

You dropped your goals

### Ryan

And always dropping his goals. We should really get going on those people with machine guns that are coming up after us on skis are really scary

### Pete

The stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet

### Ryan

This pizza is a little bit weird doesn't really make any sense

### Ben

Hey man just now is not the time for pizza we're getting cheeseburger with machine guns dude

### Ryan

Yourself I'm not cheeseburger

### Pete

Quickly jump of a hot air balloon
Can you jump into the hot air balloon
Quickly jump in the hot air balloon
